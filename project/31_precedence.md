# 31. What is the order or precedence for all the math operators? 

... relational operators? any other operators? This requires an answer but not code or an argument. 

# Answer

This question is __not a problem__ in Clojure; it does not have precedence rules because it is fully parenthesized [@emerick2012clojure].

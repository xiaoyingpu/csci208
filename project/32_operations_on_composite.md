# 32. Are there built in operations on composite types? Whataresome?


## Answer: yes.


Clojure for instance provides excellent support for its collection composite types, including vectors, maps and lists. 


```clojure
;; get the first element
;; comes with the language
user> (first (range 1 4))
1
```

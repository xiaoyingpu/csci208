Please search for the citation keys within the project.\r\n- if you have the Haskell and LaTeX dependencies figured out, do `pandoc -s -S --bibliography biblio.bib --filter pandoc-citeproc *.md -o report.pdf` will give a nice PDF of the whole thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## How to run code\r\n\r\nSince Clojure has a very nice read-evaluate-print-loop (REPL), separate `clj` files are not provided for each question.\r\n\r\n1. Install Java.\r\n2. Install [Clojure](http://clojure.org/getting_started).\r\n3. Install [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org) and get the dependencies right.\r\n4. Run `lein repl`\r\n5. Enter code at the prompt\r\n\r\n\r\n## Good-to-have:\r\n\r\n[braveclojure](http://www.braveclojure.com/basic-emacs/) teaches how to set up your emacs to work with Clojure conveniently.\r\n","google":"UA-63010536-2","note":"Don't delete this file!

# 47. Does it claim to be portable like Java? How portable is it?

Rich Hickey, the designer of Clojure, said that Clojure was intended as a hosted language . Clojure can use Java libraries easily. This hosted feature allows Clojure be used wherever Java is used . Consequently, Clojure is very portable because JVM is; portability is one of the key features of Clojure. Besides JVM, Clojure can also be hosted on CLR (Common Language Runtime) and JavaScript.

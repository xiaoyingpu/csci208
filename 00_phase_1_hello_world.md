Hello World
===========

``` clj
(ns p1.core
  (:gen-class))

(defn -main
  "I don't do a whole lot ... yet."
  [& args]
  (println "Hello, World!"))

; This is Clojure
; yes this is generated by lein, so no ref
```

Compile and run:

make sure that you have started the project with `lein`, and then do `$ lein run` in the terminal.

Output:
````Hello, World!````


`lein`, Leiningen, is [here](http://leiningen.org).

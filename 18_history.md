# 18. Give a brief history of the language 

... and its current state (counts as one question). This question does not require additional code examples or arguments to back up your reasoning. (Just a reference)

- When was it created (range of years or a year)
- Who created it (person, committee, group at MIT, ...)?
- Is it compiled or interpreted? (Or can you do both with it?) If it’s somewhere in between, say so and explain. 
- Was it created for a purpose? What purpose?
- Is anybody hiring programmers for this language right now? Who? What kind of jobs?

## Answers

-   Clojure was created by Rich Hickey ([@richhickey]) in 2007. It took Hickey about two years to write it before the initial release (see [his github repo](https://github.com/clojure/clojure/commits/1.0.x?page=30)).
-   Clojure compiles down to Java bytecode [see a video of Hickey's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P76Vbsk_3J0&index=4&list=WL).
-   Built from Hickey’s personal revelations in working as a software engineer, Clojure was created to be the following because C++ / C\# / Java are not good enough ([see clojure's rationale](http://clojure.org/rationale)).
    -   A functional language, especially Lisp-like.
    -   symbiotic with a popular platform for portability
        and practicality.
    -   concurrency-friendly.

-   Yes. People are hiring for Clojure, and the pay is pretty good: [numbers](https://gooroo.io/analytics/skill/Clojure#.VirsSLzSxnk). Clojure jobs come from start-ups like Cognitect, and of course there are more. A search on LinkedIn revealed a variety of job opportunities ([see linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/job/clojure-jobs/?sort=relevance&page_num=1&trk=
jserp_pagination_1)) in areas of web development, data science and more.
